# CoBC-Student-Project
City of Bath College student project. No longer in active development.

This project was created for City of Bath College's English and Maths department. The idea behind it was to move their spreadsheet-based workflow to an easy-to-use system with a GUI access by multiple members of staff. They also required that the system had the ability to upload to the database the spreadsheet they were currently using for student tracking, so as to not have to re-enter every student's details.
